# Todo List

## Introduction
This project is made to practice the JavaScript OOP Principles, specifically the SOLID Principles. This app is a simple todo list that allow users to organize their tasks.

## Goals and Objectives

* Todo-items should atleast have title, description, due date, and priority properties
* The todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos
* Separate application logic from the DOM-related stuff
* The user should be able to delete a todo
* Use localStorage to store date
* Use date-fns for formatting and manipulating dates

## How it Works:

The UI has a task creator that allows the user to enter the task title, description, due date, priority, and which project should they add the task. The title and project inputs should not be empty. After inputting the details, an 'Add Task' button can be clicked to add into the browser.

The user can also add a new project by clicking the 'Add a new project' text. This provide a textbox where the user should enter the name of the project.

## Skills Emphasized in this Project:

* OOP Principles
* Factory functions and Modules
* DOM Manipulation
* DOM Element Creation
* npm
* date-fns
* Event Listeners

## Thoughts after Completion:

The planning bit of this project is complicated. Honestly, I'm not sure if I've perfectly captured the SOLID JavaScript principles. But I can say the output of this project is a success, though there is still room for more improvement.
